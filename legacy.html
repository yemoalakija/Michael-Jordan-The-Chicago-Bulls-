			<ul class="tx-lowercase">
				<li><strong>1991 NBA Finals</strong> 
					<p>Chicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. 
					Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the 
					series – which he highlighted with the iconic "switch hands" layup.</p>  
				</li>
					<hr>
				<li><strong>1992 NBA Finals</strong>  
					<p>Chicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. 
					Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for 
					"The Shrug." Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for 
					the series.</p>  
				</li>
					<hr>
				<li><strong>1993 NBA Finals </strong>  
					<p>Phoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six 
					games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists 
					for the series.</p> 
				</li>
					<hr>
				<li><strong>1996 NBA Finals </strong>  
					<p>The Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six 
					games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 
					5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, 
					which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship 
					since his father James died.<p>
				</li>
					<hr>
				<li><strong>1997 NBA Finals </strong>  
					<p>The Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games 
					behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This 
					series featured the famous "Flu Game" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points 
					despite battling flu-like symptoms.</p>
				</li>
					<hr>
				<li><strong>1998 NBA Finals </strong>  
					<p>Jordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in "The Last 
					Dance." Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 
					with "The Shot" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds 
					and 2.3 assists in the series.</p>
				</li>
				<h3><strong><u>Summary</strong></u></h3>
				<p>
					During the 90s, the Chicago Bulls were at the top of the league. Thanks to Michael Jordan leading the way, the team went a perfect 6-0 in the NBA Finals with Jordan capturing six Finals MVP Awards. Jordan led the Bulls to two different three-peats. Had he not retired from the league in 1993 for a brief time, one has to wonder if the Bulls could have won eight straight titles.
				</p>
				<p>
					When Jordan wasn’t leading the Bulls to a title, the Western Conference prevailed. That included two wins from the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon. Later in the decade, a young Tim Duncan began to start his legacy as one of the greats, while Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant were ready to duplicate a three-peat.
